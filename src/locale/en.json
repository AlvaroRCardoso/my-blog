My role in the project was to calculate the energy consumption, which sparked my interest in programming. After graduating from high school, I enrolled in a 10-month vocational course at Univates. During the course, I faced difficulties with a project and sought help from a professional in my city. That support not only helped me complete the task but also led to my first opportunity in the field, where I developed the website for Sollar Sul as a front-end developer. I am extremely grateful for this chance, as it marked the beginning of my career and pushed me to take on new challenges in web development.",
